#' Breaks for continuous variables in insurance rating
#'
#' @description The function provides an interface to finding class intervals for continuous numerical variables, for example to bin the continuous factors
#' such that categorical risk factors result which capture the effect of the covariate on the response in an accurate way,
#' while being easy to use in a generalized linear model (GLM).
#'
#' @param gam_x A fitted gam object as produced by \code{gam_frequency()}.
#' @param cp 	complexity parameter. Any split that does not decrease the overall lack of fit by a factor of cp is not attempted.
#' For instance, with anova splitting, this means that the overall R-squared must increase by \code{cp} at each step.
#' The main role of this parameter is to save computing time by pruning off splits that are obviously not worthwhile.
#' Essentially,the user informs the program that any split which does not improve the fit by \code{cp} will likely be pruned off
#' by cross-validation, and that hence the program need not pursue it (\code{cp} = 0 is default).

#' @details Bins are created where consecutive values of a continuous risk factor are grouped together. Regression trees
#' are used as a technique to perform the binning. Here regression trees from the \code{rpart} package are used.
