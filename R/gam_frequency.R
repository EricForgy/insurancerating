#' Fitting GAM for continuous variables in insurance rating (frequency)
#'
#' @description The function provides an interface to finding class intervals for continuous numerical variables, for example to bin the continuous factors
#' such that categorical risk factors result which capture the effect of the covariate on the response in an accurate way,
#' while being easy to use in a generalized linear model (GLM).
#'
#' @param data data.frame of an insurance portfolio.
#' @param nclaims column in \code{data} with number of claims.
#' @param x column in \code{data} with continuous risk factor.
#' @param exposure column in \code{data} with exposure.
#' @param accuracy_x round elements in column \code{x} to multiple of number \code{accuracy_x} (default value is 1). GAMs can be slow for fitting models with large
#' datasets. Therefore, an argument is added such that elements in the continuous risk factor are rounded and aggregated to a multiple of number \code{accuracy_x}.
#' Setting this argument equal to 1 results in a large speed enhancement. Setting this argument equal to 0 results in using the original values for the
#' continuous risk factor.
#'
#' @details A Poisson distribution is assumed for the number of claims. The logarithm of the exposure is
#' included in the model as an offset, such that the expected number of claims is proportional to exposure.
