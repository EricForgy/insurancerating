Description: Methods for insurance rating. It provides a data driven strategy for the construction of 
    insurance tariff classes. This strategy is based on the work by Antonio and Valdez (2012) <doi:10.1007/s10182-011-0152-7>.
    The package also adds functionality showing additional lines for the reference 
    categories in the levels of the coefficients in the output of a generalized linear regression analysis. 
    In addition it implements a procedure determining the level of a factor with the largest exposure, 
    and thereafter changing the base level of the factor to this level.
