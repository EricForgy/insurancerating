## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version:

* `autoplot.univ_all()` now gives correct labels on the x-axis when `ncol` > 1. 

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of insurancerating.
All packages that I could install passed.
