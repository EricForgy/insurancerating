## Resubmission

* Fixed NOTE in DESCRIPTION meta-information: author field differs from that derived from Authors@R

This is a resubmission. In this version:

* A package website is added using pkgdown.
* `construct_tariff_classes()` and `fit_gam()` now only returns tariff classes and fitted gam respectively; other items are stored as attributes.
* `univariate_frequency()`, `univariate_average_severity()`, `univariate_risk_premium()`, `univariate_loss_ratio()`, `univariate_average_premium()`, `univariate_exposure()`, and `univariate_all()` are added to perform an univariate analysis on an insurance portfolio.
* `autoplot()` creates the corresponding plots to the summary statistics calculated by `univariate_*`.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of insurancerating.
All packages that I could install passed.
