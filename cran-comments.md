## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have added:

* Function added to split rows with a time period longer than one month to multiple rows with a time period of exactly one month each.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of insurancerating.
All packages that I could install passed.
