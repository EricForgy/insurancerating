## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have added:

* Added argument in construct_tariff_classes function to construct classes for a severity model. In the previous version of this package only tariff classes for frequency models could be constructed. 

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of insurancerating.
All packages that I could install passed.
