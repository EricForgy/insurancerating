* Function construct_tariff_classes is now split in functions fit_gam and construct_tariff_classes.

## Test environments

* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs

## Downstream dependencies

All packages that I could install passed.
