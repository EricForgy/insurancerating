\title{Construct insurance tariff classes}
\usage{
construct_tariff_classes(data, nclaims, x, exposure,
  approximation = TRUE, cp = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame of an insurance portfolio.}

\item{nclaims}{column in \code{data} with number of claims.}

\item{x}{column in \code{data} with continuous risk factor.}

\item{exposure}{column in \code{data} with exposure.}

\item{approximation}{if TRUE, elements in \code{nclaims} and \code{exposure} are aggregated to the level of unique elements in \code{x}.
Approximation should be used for large insurance portfolios to avoid excessive computation times (default is TRUE).}

\item{cp}{complexity parameter. The complexity parameter (cp) is used to control the number of tariff classes. Higher values for \code{cp}
render less tariff classes. (\code{cp} = 0 is default).}
}
\value{
A list with components
\item{splits}{Vector with boundaries of the constructed tariff classes.}
\item{prediction}{Data frame with the predicted claim frequency for each element of vector \code{x}.}
\item{x}{Name of variable for which tariff classes are constructed.}
\item{tariff_classes}{Values in vector \code{x} coded according to which constructed tariff class they fall.}
}
\description{
The function provides an interface to finding class intervals for continuous numerical variables, for example to bin the continuous factors
such that categorical risk factors result which capture the effect of the covariate on the response in an accurate way,
while being easy to use in a generalized linear model (GLM).
}
\details{
Eerst iets over gams. Regression trees are used as a technique to perform the binning. Here regression trees from the \code{rpart} package are used.
A Poisson distribution is assumed for the number of claims. The logarithm of the exposure is included in the model as an offset,
such that the expected number of claims is proportional to exposure.
