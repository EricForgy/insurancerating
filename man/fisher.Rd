\title{Fisher's natural breaks classification}
\usage{
fisher(vec, n = 7)
}
\arguments{
\item{vec}{a continuous numerical variable}

\item{n}{number of classes required (n = 7 is default)}
}
\value{
Vector with clustering
}
\description{
The function provides an interface to finding class intervals for continuous numerical variables, for example for choosing colours for plotting maps.
}
\details{
The "fisher" style uses the algorithm proposed by W. D. Fisher (1958) and discussed by Slocum et al. (2005) as the Fisher-Jenks algorithm. This function is adopted from the classInt package.
